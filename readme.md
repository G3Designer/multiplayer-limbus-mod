# multiplayer-limbus mod

A mod to add multiplayer features to Limbus Company :3

## Preparation & Development

### Adding mods to Limbus

Follow the [guide](https://lethelc.site/install) on Lethe to install BepInEx and Lethe.
(This following part may be edited in the future.)

Clone this repository into the Limbus Company install folder (found by going into steam and pressing 'Browse Local Files')
And then uhh something (yk i probably did the wrong thing but who cares this will get far enough for now)

Included in this is a mod enabler for Limbus (it's literally just a powershell script) - it will disable all mods by renaming `winhttp.dll` to `mods_off.dll`

It's recommended that you play with mods on an alt account so if project moon decides they don't like mods you don't get banned on your main. When not playing with mods, just rename winhttp.dll or use the script to turn it off.

Go ahead and join the Modding server for Limbus, and read the Mod Creation guide (dw i am too) and uh yeah that's kinda it meow meow meow? meow :3
